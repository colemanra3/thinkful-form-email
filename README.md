# thinkful-form-email
For this assessment, you will get the opportunity to build an email form. You'll need to create the following fields:

- Name
- Email
- Message

If you wish to add radio buttons, checkboxes, or a drop-down menu to include additional information, you are welcome to do so. Make sure that the web page with your form is hosted on GitHub, and publish it as a GitHub Page.
